## My process
- the First step in making this project was to Bend he background image with the background color.
- Secondly the I start making the order card.
- Using Bootstrap this come together much quickly and easily.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Bootstrap v5.0]() - Bootstrap Library

### What I learned
This was my first project which forced me to use background color and image bending. I useuly use photoshop to create this type of background effects so this was kind of new for me and help me increase my knowledge regarding CSS.

background-image: **url("images/pattern-background-desktop.jpg");** -*This was the background image give*
background-color: **hsl(225, 100%, 94%);** -*And this was the color that need to bend with the image*
background-size: contain;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
**background-blend-mode: darken;** -*I choose the darken mode as it do not bend pixels but keep the darkest of the two bend color.*

### Continued development

I still fully grasped different bend mods and there implementation and I also wanna learn some different libraries like bootstrap. So this project reflected on some of my faults on which I need work on.
